        <N> What is PowerShell? </N>
        <T> 
            <P> PowerShell is a scripting language originated by Microsoft
                which can be used in a variety of different scenarios by
                anyone who knows how to use a computer.
            </P>

        <T>
            <P> What company created PowerShell? </P>
            <opt> s </opt>
            <soln> 
                <expr> Microsoft  </expr>
                <exec> 0 </exec>
            </soln>
        </T>
        <T>
            <P> PowerShell can be used for programming full applications in .NET,
                but it can also be used to perform the everyday computing tasks
                you usually perform in the Windows GUI.
            </P>

        <T>
            <P> For example, you can search for files on your hard drive
                easily in PowerShell using the Get-ChildItem command.
            </P>
        </T>
        <T>
            <P> Using the command 'Get-ChildItem C:\Windows', examine
                the contents of the Windows directory
            </P>
            <opt> p </opt>
        </T>
        <T>
            <P> Referring to the results of executing this command, look
                for an entry that starts with with the word "Policy". 
                What is the full name of this entry?
            </P>
            <opt>s</opt>
            <soln>
                <expr>
                    PolicyDefinitions
                </expr>
                <exec>
                    0
                </exec>
            </soln> 
        </T>
        <T>
            <P> As a more familiar example, let's look at the contents of
                your documents. I've stored the directories of your documents 
                in a variable 'dirdocuments' and the files of your documents in a 
                variable 'filedocuments'. Type '$dirdocuments' to see the contents
                of the first variable and '$filedocuments' to see the contents of
                the second variable
            </P>
            <opt> cp </opt>
            <code> 
                $userName = $env:USERNAME; 
                $dirDocuments = Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\$userName\Documents" -Directory
                $fileDocuments = Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\$userName\Documents" -File
            </code>

        <N> PowerShell Applications</N>
        <T>
            <P> In the previous section, we saw an example of using PowerShell 
                for the kinds of things you usually do in the Windows GUI.
                In this section, we'll consider some of the more advanced uses 
                of PowerShell.

        <T>
            <P> PowerShell can be used to manage SQL Server, SharePoint, Hyper-V,
                and many other applications
